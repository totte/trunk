What is it - or what should it be?
==================================
A Qt application (written for personal learning purposes) that allows the user 
to connect to local and remote databases directly or over SSH to run SQL 
queries and perform basic administrative tasks. It will take advantage of the 
built in SQL classes and such of Qt. Although I know very little of development 
on other platforms than GNU/Linux and Mac OS X it is intended to be 
cross-platform to the furthest extent possible of the Qt framework.

Meaning of the name, "Trunk"
============================
The common English word for the elephant proboscis, or nose. A logotype is to 
be designed, where the individual, lower-case letters of the word form an 
elephant. The "t" makes up the head, the "r" the neck, the "u" the left front 
leg, the "n" the stomach and the "k" the left hind leg.

Goals
=====
* Release 0.1.0 - Application that allows for connecting to databases
  supported by the available Qt drivers and performing manual queries.
* Release 0.2.0 - Ability to save server connection information as "Favourites"
  (excluding passwords?) for the sake of convenience.
* Release 0.3.0 - Ability to connect over SSH (is this possible?).
* Release 0.4.0 - Ability to back up data and restore data from a backup.
